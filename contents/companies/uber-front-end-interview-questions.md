Not much is known about Uber's front end interview process.

## JavaScript

- Implement a rate limiter attribute/decoration/annotation on top of an API endpoint. Caps to N requests per minute with a rolling window. [Source A](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/2409192/Uber-or-Phone-Screen-or-Senior-Front-End-Engineer) and [Source B](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124880/Rate-Limiter)

## User interface coding

- Create a button that when clicked, adds a progress bar onto the page. The progress bar would then fill up in a given amount of time (think 3 to 5 seconds). If you get past the first part, you will be asked to do throttling how many progress bars can be running at once. For example, if the limit is 3 progress bars, and the user clicks on the button 4 times, the fourth progress bar only starts after the very first one finishes.
