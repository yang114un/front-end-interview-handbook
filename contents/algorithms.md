Front End engineers are also Software Engineers after all, and it's an expectation that Front End engineers have basic competency in algorithms and data structures. It is possible and reasonable that you will be asked to solve algorithmic questions during your front end interviews and most likely you will be expected to use JavaScript.

Trees are a very common data structures in Front End because the DOM is a tree, so if you have to prioritize, definitely focus on being good at tree data structures.

The [Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction/) goes into great detail about preparing for Algorithms questions.

## JavaScript Algorithm courses

If you want more structured algorithms practice, I recommend Educative's [Ace the JavaScript Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-javascript-coding-interview?aff=x23W) course.
