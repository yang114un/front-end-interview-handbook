title: Explain `Function.prototype.bind`
---

## TL;DR

> The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

`Function.prototype.bind` allows you to create a new function with a specific `this` context and, optionally, preset arguments. `bind()` is most useful for binding the value of `this` in methods of classes that you want to pass into other functions. This was frequently done in React class component methods which were not defined using arrow functions.

```js
const john = {
  age: 42,
  getAge: function () {
    return this.age;
  },
};

console.log(john.getAge()); // 42

const unboundGetAge = john.getAge;
console.log(unboundGetAge()); // undefined

const boundGetAge = john.getAge.bind(john);
console.log(boundGetAge()); // 42

const mary = { age: 21 };
const boundGetAgeMary = john.getAge.bind(mary);
console.log(boundGetAgeMary()); // 21
```

In the example above, when the `getAge` method is called without a calling object (as `unboundGetAge`), the value is `undefined` because the value of `this` within `getAge()` becomes the global object. `boundGetAge()` has its `this` bound to `john`, hence it is able to obtain the `age` of `john`.

We can even use `getAge` on another object which is not `john`! `boundGetAgeMary` returns the `age` of `mary`.

## Use Cases

### Fixing the `this` value in callbacks

When you pass a function as a callback, the `this` value inside the function can be unpredictable. Using `bind()` helps ensure that the correct `this` value is maintained.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  greet: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

// Without bind(), `this` inside the callback will be the global object
setTimeout(person.greet, 1000); // Output: "Hello, my name is undefined"

// Using bind() to fix the `this` value
setTimeout(person.greet.bind(person), 1000); // Output: "Hello, my name is John Doe"
```

You can also use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) for this purpose instead of `bind`.

```js
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  greet: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

setTimeout(() => person.greet(), 1000); // Output: "Hello, my name is John Doe"
```

### Partial application of functions (currying)

`bind()` can be used to create a new function with some arguments pre-set. This is known as partial application or currying.

```js
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// Using bind() to create a new function with some arguments pre-set
const multiplyBy5 = multiply.bind(null, 5);
console.log(multiplyBy5(3)); // Output: 15
```

### Converting instance methods to standalone functions

When you need to use an instance method as a standalone function, `bind()` can help.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const john = new Person('John');
john.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John"

// Converting the instance method to a standalone function using bind()
const johnGreet = john.greet.bind(john);
johnGreet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is John"
```
