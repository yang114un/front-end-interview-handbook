We typically do not accept submissions for new questions. This is because the [original questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) has been curated by a team of industry professionals and we use it as ground truth and keep our answers in sync with the questions/answers as much as possible. If you are keen to add a question/answer, firstly try to submit an issue/pull request to that repository, once your question is merged, you can then make a pull request with your answers to this repository.
