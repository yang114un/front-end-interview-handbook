## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, if it is a non-trivial change, please first discuss the change you wish to make via creating an issue in this repository.

### Submitting New Questions

We typically do not accept submissions for new questions. This is because the [original questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) has been curated by a team of industry professionals and we use it as ground truth and keep our answers in sync with the questions/answers as much as possible. If you are keen to add a question/answer, firstly try to submit an issue/pull request to that repository, once your question is merged, you can then make a pull request with your answers to this repository.

### Answering Questions

You are welcome to make improvements to existing answers and/or answer unanswered questions. Try to add a list of references you used when arriving at the answers or any supplementary material that might be useful. This would be helpful for readers who would like to go further in-depth into the answer.

As much as possible, try to follow the existing format of markdown and code. Any JavaScript code added should adopt [Standard style](https://standardjs.com/).

### Translations

Feel free to add translations for the questions and answers. You might want to retrieve a translated copy of the questions from [the original repository] and start from there. Simply create an issue expressing interest in being a translator and you will be added to the repository. Translators have the responsibility of keeping the translated content up to date with the master copy. However, the `master` branch is protected from direct writes and translated work have to be go through the Pull Request and review process before it can be merged into the repository. This is more for organizational purposes as different translators tend to have individual collaboration approach (some prefer merging, some prefer rebasing). Going through a Pull Request process will make the commit history more organized and clean.
