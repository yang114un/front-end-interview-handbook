We do not typically accept new question submissions. We will use the [original questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) as ground truth and sync up our questions/answers with that repository as much as possible. If you are keen to add a question/answer, firstly try to submit an issue/pull request to that repository. This is because there is an awesome team of reviewers in that repository who will curate the original questions list and ensure that the question bank is of high quality. Once your question is merged, you can then make a pull request with your answers to this repository.
