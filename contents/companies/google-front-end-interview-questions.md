> Web Front End: â€‹You should be ready to cover topics like front end latency and implementation of standard CS algorithms using idiomatic JavaScript. You should be able to articulate Javascript strengths and shortcomings and ready to cover any of the following: Web security issues (XSS, XSRF), Prototypal inheritance, DOM API & manipulation, CSS manipulation, Browser / DOM events & event handling, XHR requests & HTTP headers, JavaScript closures

  - [Practice question](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/tic-tac-toe) (Paid)
- Implement nested checkboxes (when the parent is checked, children are checked and vice versa. Use `<input type="checkbox">`). Similar to [Indeterminate checkboxes](https://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/).
- Design a webpage which can auto load new posts when you reach the bottom of the page by using JavaScript. You may use AJAX and JavaScript event listeners.

  - [Practice question](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/javascript/throttle) (Paid)
  - Example: Number of rows: 4, Number of columns: 5, "Submit" button. Clicking on the "Submit" button will show the following table (ignore the styling):

| 1   | 8   | 9   | 16  | 17  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 7   | 10  | 15  | 18  |

- Minesweeper problem. Write a function `reveal()` that outputs the number of tiles shown when a user clicks on a tile. Each tile shows the number of bombs as its neighbor. If the user click on a tile that is a bomb, the game is over. If that tile is 0, reveal all its neighbors.
- You are given four numbers (type int), and have four basic math operators at your disposal (+, -, x, /). Given arbitrary ways to group the numbers and using any of the operators, determine if you can make the number 24 from the four numbers. The numbers must be processed in the order they appear.
- Find k-nearest points.
