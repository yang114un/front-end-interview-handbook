title: Explain event delegation
---

## TL;DR
**Event delegation** is a JavaScript design pattern where a single event listener is attached to a common ancestor to manage events for multiple child elements efficiently.

**Practical Use:** It's essential for handling events on dynamic or numerous elements, such as list items, without attaching individual listeners to each.

**Benefit:** Event delegation improves performance, reduces memory usage, and simplifies code maintenance.

**Pitfall:** Incorrectly identifying the event target can lead to unintended behavior.

Event delegation is a design pattern in JavaScript used to efficiently manage and handle events on multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor element. This pattern is particularly valuable in scenarios where you have a large number of similar elements, such as list items, and want to streamline event handling.

## How Event Delegation works

1. **Attach a listener to a common ancestor**: Instead of attaching individual event listeners to each child element, you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor element higher in the DOM hierarchy.
1. **Event bubbling**: When an event occurs on a child element, it bubbles up through the DOM tree to the common ancestor element. During this propagation, the event listener on the common ancestor can intercept and handle the event.
1. **Determine the target**: Within the event listener, you can inspect the event object to identify the actual target of the event (the child element that triggered the event). You can use properties like `event.target` or `event.currentTarget` to determine which specific child element was interacted with.
1. **Perform action based on target**: Based on the target element, you can perform the desired action or execute code specific to that element. This allows you to handle events for multiple child elements with a single event listener.

## Benefits of event delegation

1. **Efficiency**: Event delegation reduces the number of event listeners, improving memory usage and performance, especially when dealing with a large number of elements.
1. **Dynamic elements**: It works seamlessly with dynamically added or removed child elements, as the common ancestor continues to listen for events on them.

## Example

Here's a simple example using modern ES6 syntax:

```js
// HTML:
// <ul id="item-list">
//   <li>Item 1</li>
//   <li>Item 2</li>
//   <li>Item 3</li>
// </ul>

const itemList = document.getElementById('item-list');

itemList.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`Clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

In this example, a single click event listener is attached to the `<ul>` element. When a click event occurs on an `<li>` element, the event bubbles up to the `<ul>` element, where the event listener checks the target's tag name to identify which list item was clicked.

## Use Cases

Event delegation is commonly used in scenarios like:

### Managing lists, menus, or tables with many items or rows

```js
// HTML:
// <ul id="item-list">
//   <li>Item 1</li>
//   <li>Item 2</li>
//   <li>Item 3</li>
// </ul>

const itemList = document.getElementById('item-list');

itemList.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`Clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

In this example, a single click event listener is attached to the `<ul>` element. When a click event occurs on an `<li>` element, the event bubbles up to the `<ul>` element, where the event listener checks the target's tag name to identify which list item was clicked.

### Handling dynamic content in single-page applications
```js
// HTML:
// <div id="button-container">
//   <button>Button 1</button>
//   <button>Button 2</button>
// </div>
// <button id="add-button">Add Button</button>

const buttonContainer = document.getElementById('button-container');
const addButton = document.getElementById('add-button');

buttonContainer.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
    console.log(`Clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});

addButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const newButton = document.createElement('button');
  newButton.textContent = `Button ${buttonContainer.children.length + 1}`;
  buttonContainer.appendChild(newButton);
});
```

In this example, a click event listener is attached to the `<div>` container. When a new button is added dynamically and clicked, the event listener on the container handles the click event.

### Simplifying code by avoiding the need to attach and remove event listeners for elements that change

```js
// HTML:
// <form id="user-form">
//   <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
//   <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email">
//   <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
// </form>

const userForm = document.getElementById('user-form');

userForm.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
  const { name, value } = event.target;
  console.log(`Changed ${name}: ${value}`);
});
```

In this example, a single input event listener is attached to the form element. It handles input changes for all child input elements, simplifying the code by avoiding multiple event listeners.

## Pitfalls

- **Incorrect Target Handling:** Ensure correct identification of the event target to avoid unintended actions.
- **Event Overhead:** While event delegation is efficient, handling complex logic within the event listener can introduce overhead if not managed properly.
