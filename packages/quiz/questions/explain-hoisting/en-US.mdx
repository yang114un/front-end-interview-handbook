title: Explain "hoisting"
---

Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the `var` keyword will have their declaration "moved" up to the top of their module/function-level scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.

Note that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes. It is just easier to understand this behavior by visualizing the declarations as being hoisted to the top of their scope. Let's explain with a few examples.

```js
console.log(foo); // undefined
var foo = 1;
console.log(foo); // 1
```

Function declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions (written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable declaration hoisted.

```js
// Function Declaration
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]
foo(); // 'FOOOOO'
function foo() {
  console.log('FOOOOO');
}
console.log(foo); // [Function: foo]

// Function Expression
console.log(bar); // undefined
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function () {
  console.log('BARRRR');
};
console.log(bar); // [Function: bar]
```

Variables declared via `let` and `const` are hoisted as well. However, unlike `var` and `function`, they are not initialized and accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError` exception. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.

```js
x; // undefined
y; // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization

var x = 'local';
let y = 'local';
```

In reality, JavaScript creates all variables in the current scope before it even tries to executes the code. Variables created using `var` keyword will have the value of `undefined` where variables created using `let` and `const` keywords will be marked as `<value unavailable>`. Thus, accessing them will cause a `ReferenceError` preventing you to access them before intialization.

In ECMAScript specifications `let` and `const` declarations are [explained as below](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-let-and-const-declarations):

> The variables are created when their containing Environment Record is instantiated but may not be accessed in any way until the variable's LexicalBinding is evaluated.

However, this statement is [a litle bit different for `var` keyword](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-variable-statement):

> Var variables are created when their containing Environment Record is instantiated and are initialized to `undefined` when created.
