title: What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
---

## TL;DR

Anonymous function in Javascript is a function that does not have any name associated with it. It is used in various scenarios to encapsulate code within a local scope, as callbacks, or as arguments to functional programming constructs. 

```js
// Encapsulating Code
(function () {
  // Some code here.
})();

// Callbacks
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);

// Functional programming constructs
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function (el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

Anonymous functions, or functions without a name, are extensively used in JavaScript for various purposes due to their flexibility and versatility.

## Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)

Anonymous functions are commonly used in Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) to encapsulate code within a local scope. This prevents variables declared within the function from leaking to the global scope, and preventing namespace pollution.

```js
// This is an IIFE
(function() {
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
})();

// x is not accessible here
console.log(typeof x); // undefined
```
In the above example, the IIFE creates a local scope for the variable `x`. As a result, `x` is not accessible outside the IIFE, thus preventing it from leaking into the global scope.

## Callbacks 

Anonymous functions can be used as callbacks that are used once and do not need to be used anywhere else. The code will seem more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code calling them, rather than having to search elsewhere to find the function body.

```js
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
```

## Higher-order functions

It is used as arguments to functional programming constructs like Higher-order functions or Lodash (similar to callbacks). Higher-order functions take other functions as arguments or return them as results. Anonymous functions are often used with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const double = arr.map(function (el) {
  return el * 2;
});
console.log(double); // [2, 4, 6]
```

## Additional Use Cases of Anonymous Functions as Callbacks in React

In React, anonymous functions are widely used for handling events and passing callbacks as props. Here are some common scenarios:

### Event Handling

Anonymous functions are commonly used to handle events in React components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <button onClick={() => console.log('Button Clicked')}>
            Click Me
        </button>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Passing Callbacks to Child Components
Anonymous functions are often passed as props to child components to handle specific actions.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ChildComponent({ onButtonClick }) {
    return (
        <button onClick={onButtonClick}>
            Click Me
        </button>
    );
}

function ParentComponent() {
    const handleClick = () => {
        console.log('Button Clicked in Parent Component');
    };

    return (
        <ChildComponent onButtonClick={() => handleClick()} />
    );
}

export default ParentComponent;
```

### Using Hooks

Anonymous functions are frequently used in conjunction with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

- `useState`:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Counter;
```
- `useEffect`:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

function Timer() {
    useEffect(() => {
        const timer = setInterval(() => {
            console.log('Tick');
        }, 1000);

        return () => clearInterval(timer);
    }, []);

    return <div>Check the console for ticks</div>;
}

export default Timer;
```
