:::

Trivia-style questions are usually found in the first few stages of an interview as the answers are usually short and can possibly be administered by a minimally-technical recruiter.

Trivia questions are meant to test how well candidates understand the theory behind the domain. They can be aced by either having real solid understanding of the concepts or by pure memorization of answers. While there can be infinitely many possible quiz questions, the most common questions can be found within the next few pages.

## Basic examples

- JavaScript
  - What is a closure?
  - Explain what promises are and what they're useful for.
  - What is the difference between a promise and a callback?
  - Explain `this` in JavaScript.
- CSS
  - Explain the CSS box model.
  - Explain the various CSS `position` properties and its differences.

## Advanced examples

For more senior candidates, expect to explain more advanced stuff with no absolute answers.

- How does React work? What is virtual DOM and what problems does it solve?
- Why did you use library X over library Y?

The best and correct way to prepare for such questions is to really understand the concepts and get some hands-on experience in applying them in a project. Memorizing the answers is not recommended but is acceptable if you are running out of time.
